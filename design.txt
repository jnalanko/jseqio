// Questions: BufRead or Read

// Functionality:
// In-memory: all().iter()
// Streaming: next()
// Get name which is the first token of the header
// Result types everywhere where things can fail (todo at least writer is missing these)
// Figure out file extension string including the .gz part
// Take in the correct strings types, not std::String always
// Empty file should work
// By default always write in same format as reading
// Derive all the commonly needed traits like Debug etc

// Is this 'static necessary?
    // Need to constrain + 'static because boxed things always need to have a static
    // lifetime.
